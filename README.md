# algo-trade

Please note that this is a single threaded python
application that look for certain mean deviation
method and buys and sells according to it
this code does not contain the api's for
making the buy and sell instructions.
So this is an intermediate project for someone
to work on.

Also as this is single threaded application
this system can only enter one trade at a time
although i can program it to be multithreaded
i can't test its efficiency using my
computer. And i made this project when i was in
12th on a 32 bit computer that didn't support pandas
so this is a Good project for anyone who
wants to understand how python work with json 
and csv files without the use of libraries
